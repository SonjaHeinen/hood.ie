## Design
  
> ‚ÄúThis change is a reflection of preferences within our community, as well as an acknowledgement of our position in an increasingly interconnected world. Encouraging free and open source software realigns our policies with our mission. As an academic institution, we believe that in many cases we can achieve greater impact by sharing our work.‚Äù

He tracked everything in a spreadsheet, with a person‚Äôs name, their department, and that one fact.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe brain‚Äôs craving for novelty, constant stimulation and immediate gratification creates something called a ‚Äòcompulsion loop.‚Äô Like lab rats and drug addicts, we need more and more to get the same effect. Endless access to new information also easily overloads our working memory. When we reach cognitive overload, our ability to transfer learning to long-term memory significantly deteriorates. It‚Äôs as if our brain has become a full cup of water and anything more poured into it starts to spill out.‚Äù
