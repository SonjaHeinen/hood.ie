Hello all! I recently had the great honor of interviewing Nick Hehr ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/hipsterbrown), [GitHub](https://github.com/hipsterbrown)). Let’s see what he had to say:

## 1. What’s your favorite animal?

While I’m a massive fan of dogs, yet another reason why I love the Hoodie mascot, I’ve always been fascinated by owls. It probably started after watching The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh as a kid. Owls, as I’ve seen them, are usually portrayed as wise, knowledgeable creatures and good friends. Plus, how can you not love [Hedwig’s Theme from the Harry Potter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTXBLyp7_Dw) movies?

## 2. What’s your role / what have you contributed to Hoodie?

I’ve contributed to Hoodie in quite a few ways over the years. Ever since meeting Gregor online and learning a bit about the project, I’ve been a great fan and proponent. I started speaking about it at local meetups and creating a few demo apps as I was learning more about web development. My first direct contribution to Hoodie was through writing app tutorials for the documentation, which helped me dig into how it all worked under the hood (no pun intended). From there, I got involved with the latest Hoodie rewrite after some encouragement from amazing Hoodie core team. I began contributing frontend code and discussing architectural decisions, learning tons about how to maintain an inclusive, open source community. Lately, I’ve been helping maintain the various Hoodie repos by reviewing issues and welcoming new contributors through Meet the Hoodies events. Best part of my day is merging a PR from a new contributor and welcoming them to this wonderful project.

## 3. What’s your favorite use of Hoodie in the wild?

I don’t have any Hoodie apps in production at the moment but I have been working on combining it with another open-source project called [Tessel](https://tessel.io/), to which I’ve recently started contributing. Tessel is a custom development board and software platform that can be programmed using Node.js. My goal is to use Hoodie and Tessel to make an approachable, open source IoT stack for folks to connect their web apps to embeddable hardware. It’s a work in progress that I hope to have working later this year.

## 4. What in your opinion makes the Hoodie project unique and interesting?

I absolutely adore the many [mascots of Hoodie](http://hood.ie/animals/), especially since I know of a few that have yet to be revealed, but my favorite part and reason for getting involved with Hoodie is the people. __Code may start a project but people make it a community,__ and a healthy, inclusive community, is how projects like Hoodie live on, even if founders and core contributors move on to other endeavors. People like [Charlotte](https://twitter.com/Charlotteis), [Gregor](https://twitter.com/gr2m), [Jenn](https://twitter.com/jennwrites), and [Jan](https://twitter.com/janl) teach and inspire me to take the lessons I’ve learned from Hoodie and share them with other projects, communities, and events. My final goal is to see the standard of open source projects as empathetic, inclusive places for people from around the world to gather, learn, and share.

## 5. What advice do you have for aspiring Hoodie contributors?

I would not be where I am today without the support and mentorship of the amazing folks I’ve had the privilege to meet in person and online. From local meetups and international conferences to Twitter and GitHub, I’ve tried to always ask questions when I don’t understand, build things I think are interesting, and stick with the groups that care more about including people than writing code. It is those groups that led me to keep learning about development, empathy, and sharing any knowledge I gain with others. Lastly, be sure to take care of yourself as well.
